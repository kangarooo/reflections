	How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It showed what is changed- lost and added and only thouse lines i need to read to understand bug in code.

	How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
I can allways find old bugs and how programm was developed. What was when added and how important each part was from start.

	What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
I can put commit when needed and when commit is ready and not when its in middle and lost.

	Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Thats a system for whole programm to work with all option in one place having all related files together.

	How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
With log i see change descriptions and with diff comparison differences from 2 changes.

	How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Couse i can revert and find possible problem changes.

	Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I want to make worpress plugin changes.
