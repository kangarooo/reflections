What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
I start new project and prepare it for versioning. It helps track changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is making start and working is where i make changes. Repo is already added change version save place. It gives place for ready product, change of product and preperation of product.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
I put files witch are ready and done.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
When i want to make new feature not intented in main programm. Then i can use my own version.
