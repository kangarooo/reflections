	When workin with team or making public good project available for all.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	So i can write what has been changed.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Fork is ready product in github made ready for public changes. Clone is copy of product. Branch is subpart of product.
